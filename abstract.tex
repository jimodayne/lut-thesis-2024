    % Open source software (OSS) has become a dominant force in the software industry. However, the motivations behind developer participation in these projects remain a topic of ongoing exploration. This thesis investigates the factors that drive developers to contribute their time and skills to OSS projects.

    % Through a review of existing literature and potentially [mention your research methodology, e.g., surveys, interviews], this study examines various potential motivations for OSS participation. These may include:

    % Intrinsic factors: Intellectual challenge, learning and development, desire to contribute to the greater good.
    % Extrinsic factors: Career advancement, building reputation, access to a community of developers.
    % Project-specific factors: Alignment with personal interests, technical merit of the project, clear contribution guidelines.

    % The thesis aims to identify the relative importance of these factors and how they might interact to influence developer behavior. By understanding the motivations of OSS contributors, the project seeks to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the open source ecosystem and its sustainability.
