    This thesis embarks on an in-depth exploration of the intricate landscape of open-source software development, with a particular emphasis on the multifaceted motivations that drive developers to contribute to these projects. Utilizing Kitchenham's framework as a guiding principle, a systematic literature review was conducted, meticulously examining existing research to uncover the diverse factors influencing developer engagement. By analyzing a carefully curated selection of 20 pertinent articles, this study delves into the social impact, challenges, and underlying motivations within the open-source software community. The findings aim to illuminate the complexities of developer behavior in open-source projects, identify gaps in existing theoretical frameworks, and provide addition insight for future research in this dynamic and ever-evolving field.
