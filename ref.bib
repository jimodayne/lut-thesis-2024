@article{FuggettaAlfonso2003Osse,
  abstract  = {The success of Linux and Apache has strengthened the opinion that the open source paradigm is one of the most promising strategies to enhance the maturity, quality, and efficiency of software development activities. This observation, however, has not been discussed in much detail and critically addressed by the software engineering community. Most of the claims associated with open source appear to be weakly motivated and articulated.
               For this reason, this paper proposes some qualitative reflections and observations on the nature of open source software and on the most popular and important claims associated with the open source approach. The ultimate goal of the paper is to identify the concepts and intuitions that are really peculiar to open source, and to distinguish them from features and aspects that can be equally applied to or found in proprietary software.},

We examine how the context of the open source project, and the personal values of contributors, are related to the types of motivations for contributing. A web-based survey was administered to 300 contributors in two prominent open source contexts: software and content. As hypothesized, software contributors placed a greater emphasis on reputation-gaining and self-development motivations, compared with content contributors, who placed a greater emphasis on altruistic motives. Furthermore, the hypothesized relationships were found between contributors’ personal values and their motivations for contributing.},

@article{OMahonySiobhán2007Tgoo,
  abstract  = {The concept of "open source" software initially referred to software projects managed by grassroots communities in public forums. Since 1998, the concept has been adapted and diffused to new settings that extend beyond software. While the open source community has maintained control over which software licenses can be considered "open source", little attention has been paid to the elements that constitute community management. More private parties now contribute to OSS communities and more hybrid governance models have emerged. Before we can understand how hybrid models differ from a community managed model, a more precise definition is needed. This essay takes a step in this direction by identifying five core principles critical to community-managed governance. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract  = {In 2004 the concept of evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) was introduced at the ICSE04 conference.
               This study assesses the impact of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which are the recommended EBSE method for aggregating evidence.
               We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 10 journals and 4 conference proceedings.
               Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4.
               Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews. The series of cost estimation SLRs demonstrate the potential value of EBSE for synthesising evidence and making it available to practitioners.},
