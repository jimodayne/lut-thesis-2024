\section{Appendices to the thesis}\label{App:D}

Appendices may include, e.g., interview questions, survey forms, or other content relevant to the work but not necessary to include in the text body. All appendices are public and should not contain any confidential information.

In your text body, refer to the appendices by adding their title in parentheses (Appendix \ref{App:A}) where relevant. Give all appendices a title based on their content and list them in the table of contents in the order in which they are referred to in the thesis.

Single-page appendices do not require page numbering. Multiple-page appendices do.
